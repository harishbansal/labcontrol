Here are some notes about lcserver - the LabControl server implementation.

This server is a CGI script that provides
point for  objects.  Current objects supported are:
  * boards and board management processes, hardware and services

== programatic interface ==
The server handles requests from lc to put, update, query, get, and remove
objects, via it's web API.

== user interface ==
The server handles showing a user interface to examine the objects on
the server.

It can show lists of objects, and the content of individual objects.

Files:
 lcserver.py - the LabControl server
 test-server.py - a python web server (supports CGI) for testing purposes
 start_server - a shell script to start the test server
 make-otp-file - script used to create a one-time-pad file
   (which is used for authenticating operations from labs)

Data Files:
 The 'lc-data' directory hierarchy has single files (usually json) that are
 used to represent objects, including boards, resources, and requests
  * boards - board-{name}.json files
  * resources - resource-{name}.json files
  * requests - request-{name-timestamp}.json files
  * logs - log-{name-timestamp}.txt files
